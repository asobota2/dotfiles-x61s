# /etc/fstab: static file system information.
#
# noatime turns off atimes for increased performance (atimes normally aren't
# needed); notail increases performance of ReiserFS (at the expense of storage
# efficiency). It's safe to drop the noatime options if you want and to
# switch between notail / tail freely.
#
# The root filesystem should have a pass number of either 0 or 1.
# All other filesystems should have a pass number of 0 or greater than 1.
#
# See the manpage fstab(5) for more information.
#

# NOTE: If your BOOT partition is ReiserFS, add the notail option to opts.
#
# NOTE: Even though we list ext4 as the type here, it will work with ext2/ext3
#       filesystems. This just tells the kernel to use the ext4 driver.
#
# NOTE: You can use full paths to devices like /dev/sda3, but it is often
#       more reliable to use filesystem labels or UUIDs. See your filesystem
#       documentation for details on setting a label. To obtain the UUID, use
#       the blkid(8) command.

# NOTE: defaults sets the default options
#       noatime disabled registering access times which improves performance
#       discard is recommended for SSD drives (ext4 and btrfs)
#
# NOTE: The fifth field determines if the partition needs to be dumped
#
# NOTE: The sixth field is used by fsck to determine the order in which filesystems
#       should be checked if the system wasn't shut down properly. The root filesystem
#       should have 1 while the rest should have 2 (or 0 if a fsck isn't necessary)
